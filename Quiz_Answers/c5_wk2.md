# Recurrent Neural Networks

### 1
False

### 2
A non-linear dimensionality reduction technique

> Tx = Ty

### 3
True

### 4
 $$e_{boy} - e_{girl} \approx e_{brother} - e{sister}$$

 $$e_{boy} - e_{brother} \approx e_{girl} - e{sister}$$

### 5

It is computationally wasteful

### 6

True

### 7

$$c$$ and $$t$$ are chosen to be nearby words

### 8

$$\theta_t$$ and $$e_c$$ are both 500 dimensional vectors

$$\theta_t$$ and $$e_c$$ are both trained with an optimization algorithm such as Adam or gradient descent

### 9

$$\theta_i$$ and $$e_j$$ should be initialized randomly at the beginning of training

$$X_{ij}$$ is the number of times word i appears in the context of word j

The weighting funciton $$f(.)$$ must satisfy $$f(0) = 0$$

### 10

$$m_1$$ >> $$m_2$$
